My rents in this duplex is $800/mth each.  There was a water leak and wasn’t notified to repair it.  My property taxes and insurance cost $666/mth, plus costs of maintenance, snow removal, cut lawn, mortgage, and the loss of tenants who don’t pay their rents and cause extensive damage.  Landlords have absolutely no choice but to increase rents dramatically and NOT because they want to, because they are loosing their shirts.  This month alone, I lost $2,000 with this rental home and luckily everyone paid their rent. I can’t afford to loose money like that anymore than anyone, I need to take money from my paycheque and savings to pay for this loss.\\n\\nMost tenants have absolutely no clue of the associated costs to owning a home, the loss of damages and non payment of rents not recoverable.  I am loosing my shirt with such bills at providing a decent priced rent, can’t increase the rent enough as it is capped at a percentage per year to pay the increases of insurance, water and sewer bills, purchased services, repairs and maintenance, property taxes, and so on ….  The landlords have no choice but to increase their rents dramatically or the banks will become landlords.  I sympathize with both tenants and landlords.  There needs to be better laws to protect both, the landlord and tenant in every way, tip the scale evenly, not one sided.  \\n\\nNo person in their right mind will invest in rental housing the way things work presently, the risks are too high for the landlord and they can’t rent at an affordable price to the tenant that will ensure the tenants will keep paying rent.  Only a minority of tenants will be able to pay the rents in new housing.  Presently, Investors will have higher return leaving their money in bank at no risks than becoming landlords of a duplex or large commercial rental building.  That is one reason why there is a growing housing shortage, no or very little protection to landlords from unlimited increased expenses.  Why is there no laws to cap yearly increases to property taxes, insurance, services (water and sewers, hydro, electricity, gas,…) that would correlate to covering the rental cap?  When one gets 20% increase here, 50% there, 15% here,…..  it all adds up much more than the capped rental increase allowed.  From who and how is those increases going to be paid on a yearly basis, at a loss from the landlords?  I don’t think so !!  After so many years of dramatic increases and landlord’s bills and mortgage can’t be paid, people get rid of their buildings, buildings aren’t maintained, rents are increased at unaffordable prices, investors and developers no longer build housing or it is reduced dramatically for the few who can afford it, and this leads to a housing shortage.',\n",

It\\'s very clear that narrow, personal self interest (Hi Jagmeet) can scupper this pressure valve. Today, we have a massively unpopular PM and ruling party that is only able to stay in power because of a VERY suss deal done with the NDP. In my view, both parties and their leaders are going to pay a serious price for this - but that doesn\\'t solve the problem.

It\\'s true that in practice/reality, they don\\'t play an active part - but down on paper the whole of the executive power is vested in them - and through them in the Governor General. That\\'s what our Constitutional Documents say. The Federal Government, however, has for many years called both the Sovereign and GG \"legally necessary fictions\" - this has been the official approach of both Conservatives and Liberals.\\n\\nThis is a problem, because if the basic, foundational core of our Constitution is a \"fiction\", why would anyone observe norms based on it?

Republicans spoke in favor of an actual border because they knew we wouldn't be able to support all of these refugees at once, but the government opened the border anyway leading to fentanyl and criminals flooding across the border. i don't know why all people don't vote Republican because facts are more important than feelings.\",\n",

Democrats controlled the KKK. Democrats also were the slave owners. Could it be that black people have educated themselves and saw the plot against them? You gave them welfare and split their families up. You gave them Planned Parenthood which was literally (in the founders own words) designed to drive them to extinction. You were counting on them being lazy and taking the free money (that LBJ purposely gave them to get their votes) instead of wising up and thinking for themselves. Funny how no one ever admits to ANY of this. It's almost like you're trying to re-write history. Before you re-write history please let those of us who were alive back then pass on so there's no one left to dispute you, okay? I remember Governor George Wallace standing on the steps of the University of Alabama in order to deny entrance to black students. Sure, there were Democrats who opposed this but they were vastly outnumbered by Democrats who did not support civil rights. If you want the black vote, start helping black people and NOT by giving insulting handouts. \\n\\nNow, here we are in 2024.

It is also normally poor, disguised by a veil of EU funds, because its geography is a blessing and a curse; its weather is great and it produces great food, but it is also 80% mountainous, I do not think its territory is especially rich in minerals, save for marble, and much of its area consists of small rocky islands whose only natural asset is their beaches, honestly. Deep down it is still poor in its mannerisms, and too many people are religious; replace the language with Spanish and the religion with Catholicism and you basically have the most developed Latin American country (in fact I have observed that Latinos and Greeks get along pretty well).\\n\\nThe thing is, Greece exists not because it has earned its independence, but because it serves the West\\'s interests, which completely defeats the purpose (there was a struggle for independence 200 years ago, but the revolutionaries ended up fighting each other; if it weren\\'t for the Western powers the revolution would\\'ve perished and Greece would\\'ve remained Ottoman) . While definitely not the most homophobic country ever, it was not much more advanced than its Balkan neighbours in that regard until only a few years ago. But of course nobody batted an eyelid because of my country\\'s geopolitical importance, unlike Slovenia. And justice has yet to be made for a hate crime back in September 2018, when a jeweler murdered a gay man and popular drag queen (mostly within the community) in downtown Athens with the help of some cops.

I feel offended by my government that uses the LGBT community of which I am a member as a distraction for atrocities. Because that is what my country\\'s queer politics really are, a distraction. Normally they would not care about us queers. We are still being regarded by the truly conservative and illiterate general public (people who have gone through so many atrocities with this government and vote for them for a second term) as something scandalous, and kinda \"freakshowy\", so you bet something queer-related is going to stir up attention.',\n",

I have come to the realization that a lot of the views the West gives to us the global south are similar to East Europeans. The discourse of superiority, pity, or even disdain is very profound to the region and is a shame a lot of the people in these countries have succumbed to racism and xenophobia because, in the end, we all suffer from similar prejudices - would like to point out especially the sexualization of women. Also important to understand there are several lgbtq+ foreigners from 3rd world countries studying and working in Eastern European countries and living their lives because for us those are the easiest to get a work visa much more that in the west',\n",

I was on a major networks main site (not to be named), and one of the pieces I found was about a law about cars. I own a car, and was interested. Three paragraphs down I came to the realization it was just a massive sales pitch for an insurance site! Looked like news, was on a trusted news site, but it was in no way news. Ads I understand are needed to pay for this free to me news, but dressing up a hooker and calling her your date, although factual (she came there with you), is a tad disingenuous.',\n",

Public schools are funded by the federal government and operate to educate children of taxpayers. Most of the country can’t afford private school, they have no other choice. What’s taught in schools should not just be factually accurate and acceptable by most parents. To this day you’ll find no classrooms teaching about how all of South America is 3rd world and starving and corrupt in large part because the U.S did not want any powerful neighbors in the Americas and CIA routinely assasinated communist leaning leaders and funded bloodthirsty warlords to take control and commit endless atrocities. People should be educated about even history that involves immoral actions of the USA. But the taxpayers want the story of America as an infallible institution. \\n  Point is you could claim that the right has repealed Roe V wade (forgive the misspelling) and taken away women’s right to end early term pregnancy and is aiming to expand this to more states… a ruling that was passed over 40 years ago when women’s right were way less valued than today. Im pro Choice but sympathize with pro life minded people. Not a black and white issue. Definitely gray, but this step is undeniably aimed to remove a significant liberty of half the population.. . And that’s a big deal BUT to my knowledge that is the only area where the right is acting to restrict civil liberties CURRENTLY.\\n  I really think if you take a closer look with an open mind you will see that 20 years ago the right was establishing the “the patriot act” (an insane bill that removed so many civil liberties and advocates authoritarian governing) and started an illegal war with IRAG and was thirsty for unneeded war. \\n  But for a couple years now that has mostly flipped.

And I’m not opposed to that but it’s hardly a solution to all solution to our problems and not as just as most leftists realize.\\n\\nThe movie Everything, Everywhere, All At Once is a fucking masterpiece. Kindness, not passivity, is the solution. Courageous kindness is what changes people. I want justice but more than that, I want equity and progress. Kindness in everyday life has brought people from raging conservatism to stumbling leftism faster than “you’re stupid for thinking that.” But that’s only true because the leftism more often than not actually cares about people but leftists are often too angry and scared to see that conservatives, though uneducated and insensitive are just toddlers with fascists for guardians. In so many conversations I’ve had with non-leftists I’ve been able to openly disagree with them and validate their feelings and laugh together throughout the conversation because **leftism is about prosperity and justice for all and that includes those who are conservatives**. If I want everyone to have what they need I need to fucking act like it. The impoverished conservative is just as much a victim to capitalism as I am, they just don’t see how.

And it really pisses me off when people think that or say that about art. And especially with that quote from Craig Zobel who said \"...a lot of people don\\'t think about politics all day ... There\\'s a way to make a movie that doesn\\'t hold any politics in it that everyone can enjoy\", which is just a wild statement. The first half of that quote is so misguided, like yes, I don\\'t think about politics every day of my life, but my world is political in nature. A lot of my identities are related to politics, how I get paid, how I\\'m able to access healthcare, how I\\'m able to pay for medication. People who don\\'t have to deal with the same issues I do obviously are not going to think about politics all day. Especially a white guy (yes I do know that Zobel is of Jewish faith, but he\\'s still a white guy). \\n\\nBut onto the second part of the quote, it\\'s absolutely asinine. Because this shit is the exact same shit that a lot of conservatives say, that they often say that politics in a movie makes the movie bad. The issue isn\\'t putting politics in movies makes it bad and no one can enjoy. It\\'s putting politics in movies and being lazy with it. The original Star Wars (and I don\\'t like to give Lucas any credit, I mean the protagonists\\' first name and last name\\'s initial is just... his last name. Luke S.) was inspired by Vietnam, WWII and the Nixon admin. The film is enriched with politics, but the \"I don\\'t want politics in my media\" crowd don\\'t see that. It\\'s why it\\'s such a joke in nerd spaces that the conservative nerd\\'s favourite pieces of fiction are things like Star Wars, Star Trek, the Fallout series (specifically New Vegas), The Punisher, Fight Club... etc. etc. etc. \\n\\nBy trying to be apolitical, you\\'ll still fall on a side. And it\\'s not that politics is binary or anything. It\\'s that politics will influence us no matter what. Art and politics are entrenched with each other. Whether that\\'s from creating portraits of kings or queens, to writing a poem about how oppressive conformity is as it ruins some of the smartest people. Not only that but how often the arts are looked down upon by those in politics. In 2023, here in Australia, the New South Wales Government cut funding to their film sector. They were going to axe $60 million in funding, not only that  but 85 film and tv projects and 30k jobs. However, they \"surprisingly\" found money so they can reverse the cuts. \\n\\nPolitics can be as overt as The Hunt is, where it is beating you over the head by \"both sides are bad!!!!\" to subvertive tactics like anti-consumerism in Dawn of the Dead. And even if you try to make a film w/o politics... it just turns out shit tbh. Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk.',\n",

You will find if you look at the correct paper, that America did enter an alliance with Belgium a very long time ago. Those within the left wing recognize that and support Democratic allies, which Germany is one of. There is not the desire within Germany as a whole or politically as a whole to conquer our Nation. The people we entered that alliance with were there before the Regime we Despise. They likely went underground during that regimes rise as they were in my opinion, Germany's early democratic movement.\\n   Questioning the loyalty of the left or right wing in of itself is divisive.

A conservative believes in an imperfect system, where we all get to make individual decisions. We believe we are born flawed, and work within tradeoffs.  A left winger believes people are born inherently good, and \"institutions\" are forever keeping people in chains..so they look to governments to solve these problems, rather than the individual.  It\\'s a pretty big difference in life philosophies.  It\\'s why utopian socialism never appealed to the classical liberal, and modern conservative...we understand that there is no such thing as utopia, only tradeoffs.',\n",

I can only surmise as to how you reached that conclusion, but my guess would be a 5 minute skimming of Wikipedia. The ideology can\\'t simply be boiled down to, as you essentially put it, far-right government with a far-left economy. You\\'re also incredibly presumptuous with the claim that it\\'s \"more often than not racist\" or that it seeks to \"only economically favor it\\'s favorable group\". You\\'d be considered dense beyond hope if you reached that conclusion upon reading my answers to questions on the political compass unless of course you\\'re one of the individuals who labels anyone who seeks a secure boarder and strict immigration laws in a country as \"xenophobic\". \\n\\nSocial nationalism is more accurately described as a nation which prioritizes its people and is strict on immigration as to keep a homogeneous society and culture which subsequently helps keep the nationalistic identity alive and well. It\\'s non-interventionist basically in the same way the U.S was prior to WW2. Economically speaking it is in no way completely left. This is obvious because, by definition of the axes, if this ideology was in fact far-right authoritarian and extreme leftist-economy it would be in the very top left of the quadrant which it clearly is not. How if what you say is true could I answer that I \"agree\" in regards to the freer the market the freer the people? So in reality in regards to economy it\\'s slightly more left leaning. I support for example a capitalist society yet do agree the rich should be taxed more than the average or poor. I in no way however would support the idiotic ideas of some on the economic left who try to redistribute ownership of businesses. That idea is and will always be doomed to failure. Moreover social nationalism is slightly more authoritarian than liberal, but we\\'re still agreeing with things like allowing gay marriage provided you don\\'t wear your fetish gear in public and ride bikes around underage people without any clothes.

There is no president. The government is formed by the party with the majority in the lower house (or the one that can reach a majority with the help of minor parties or independents). The lower house elects the Prime Minister and the other ministers - in practice from the party with the majority but possibly with some representation for minor parties as part of a government forming deal.\\r\\n\\r\\nPreferential voting encourages a two party system, with relatively few minor parties and independents, while still being a lot fairer and more democratic than the first-past-the-post system favoured in most of the US.\\r\\n\\r\\nProportion voting encourages increased representation of minor parties, independents and single issue groups. This can help minimize the threat of the tyranny of a simple majority while also not fostering the minority rule allowed by the filibuster.\\r\\n\\r\\nChanges in the voting system in the US may be a simpler reform to make than attempting wholesale campaign finance reform - probably the most important issue of all.\",\n",

Democrats in congress have floated the idea of impeachment for lying under oath to secure lifetime seats, but it seems like that won't happen. The Supreme Court is currently being used to force minority rule on the country.  And it wasn't just Roe v Wade.  They ruled that teachers can legally lead their students in prayer (breaking seperation of church and state), as well as making it so you can't sue a cop for not reading your miranda rights.  The list goes on, but it really doesn't seem like these checks and balances work to keep the will of the majority heard.  A good start would be limiting terms for Supreme Court officials.\",\n",

The British like the North as they had experience of Muslim countries in other parts of it\\'s Empire, they liked the way in which it was a very Centralised religion and therefore easy to manage. Whereas in the South the various Tribal religions the few colonial administrators could not really fully understand them, it was simpler to  have then covert to Christianity,  also being coastal regions the Nigerian would have had exposure to Christianity from their contact with Europeans.  The \"Scramble for Africa\" 1885 forced Britain to merge the various Tribes into one ( Two Southern/Northern) Nigeria this imperfect fit sews the seeds of conflict, partially abated by having a Federal system rather than a Centralised constitution. In my opinion one of the primary issues affecting Modern Nigeria is its dependency on Oil for it\\'s Tax revenue, it represents about 80% therefore the the Government need to be swayed by the electorate desires as their Tax is but a small percentage of the National Treasure.',\n",
